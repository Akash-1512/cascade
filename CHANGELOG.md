## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-05

### Added
- Pydantic v2 domain models: `Objective`, `KeyResult`, `Decision`, `CheckIn`, `User`,
  `Team`, `Quarter`, with type-safe enums for status, metric type, and decision events
- Pure scoring functions (`score_linear`, `score_boolean`, `score_milestone`,
  `score_key_result`, `score_objective`) with deterministic semantics for increasing,
  decreasing, and "maintain X" KRs
- SQLAlchemy 2.0 ORM models for the seven domain tables with named constraints,
  cascading foreign keys, and indexes for the highest-volume query paths
- Async session factory and `get_session` FastAPI dependency
- Repository pattern for `Team`, `Objective`, and `Decision` aggregates
- Alembic migration `0001_initial_schema` creating all tables and Postgres enum types
- Integration test fixtures supporting both SQLite (default, fast) and Postgres
  (via `CASCADE_TEST_DATABASE_URL`)
- 120 tests total: 97 unit + 23 integration, all green

### Changed
- CI integration-tests job now exports `CASCADE_TEST_DATABASE_URL` so the suite runs
  against the Postgres service container
